Here is a collection of tutorials for tasks that I had trouble with at some point or another. <br>Most come from my [github gists](https://gist.github.com/CianMRoche) page.

- **Making and Using Custom Python Packages**  
If you want to write some python functions or classes and have them be easily available on your local machine, without interacting with conda or pip at all (to keep things as simple as possible) see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/CianMRoche/7ad0396bc4eecfaa83a42e52b090ec4f).

- **Getting Started With Computing Clusters**  
For some general cluster setup information, see [this repo (more recent)](https://github.com/CianMRoche/subMIT-setup) which was designed for the SubMIT cluster, or [this repo (a bit older)](https://github.com/CianMRoche/stampede2Setup) for Stampede2. There should be some transferrable information within, when combined with your cluster's documentation.

- **Running a Jupyter Notebook on a Computing Cluster**  
See [this github gist](https://gist.github.com/CianMRoche/ce176a089c06fd81d26f339f99f5af87) for information on running jupyter notebooks on a high performance computing cluster. to add a powershell profile function which slightly streamlines a part of that tutorial, see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/CianMRoche/2360ba2a39d36d2e3ce43e8615ddc002).

- **Get Github Copilot Subscription For Free**  
Github copilot is an incredibly helpful piece of technology, and primarily excels at aiding in monotonous coding tasks, improves commenting and code styling, and enables faster unit testing and documentation lookup. For a free subscription as a student or educator, see [these instructions](https://github.com/CianMRoche/Free-copilot).

- **Downloading GAIA Data via Python**  
GAIA is a space telescope providing unparallelled kinematics of stars in the Milky Way. For information on how to start downloading the data through python, see [this repo](https://github.com/CianMRoche/Gaia-Data-Aquisition) and for preprocessed GAIA 6D kinematics data see [this repo](https://github.com/CianMRoche/GAIA-DR3-6D-Kinematics). Also worth looking into is the software [topcat](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) which allows one to very rapidly obtain, manipulate and cross-match data from many different astronomical surveys.
