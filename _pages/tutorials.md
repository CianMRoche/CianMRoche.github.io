Here is a collection of tutorials for tasks that I had trouble with at some point or another.


## Running a Jupyter Notebook on a Computing Cluster
See [this github gist](https://gist.github.com/CianMRoche/ce176a089c06fd81d26f339f99f5af87) for information on running jupyter notebooks on a high performance computing cluster.

## Getting Started With Computing Clusters
For some general cluster setup information, see [this repo (more recent)](https://github.com/CianMRoche/subMIT-setup) which was designed for the SubMIT cluster, or [this repo (a bit older)](https://github.com/CianMRoche/stampede2Setup) for Stampede2. There should be some transferrable information within, when combined with your cluster's documentation.
