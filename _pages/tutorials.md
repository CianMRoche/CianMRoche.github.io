Here is a collection of tutorials for tasks that I had trouble with at some point or another.

## Getting Started With Computing Clusters
For some general cluster setup information, see [this repo (more recent)](https://github.com/CianMRoche/subMIT-setup) which was designed for the SubMIT cluster, or [this repo (a bit older)](https://github.com/CianMRoche/stampede2Setup) for Stampede2. There should be some transferrable information within, when combined with your cluster's documentation.

## Running a Jupyter Notebook on a Computing Cluster
See [this github gist](https://gist.github.com/CianMRoche/ce176a089c06fd81d26f339f99f5af87) for information on running jupyter notebooks on a high performance computing cluster.

## Downloading GAIA Data via Python
GAIA is a space telescope providing unparallelled kinematics of stars in the Milky Way. For information on how to start downloading the data through python, see [this repo](https://github.com/CianMRoche/Gaia-Data-Aquisition) and for preprocessed GAIA 6D kinematics data see [this repo](https://github.com/CianMRoche/GAIA-DR3-6D-Kinematics). Also worth looking into is the software [topcat](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) which allows one to very rapidly obtain, manipulate and cross-match data from many different astronomical surveys.
