Hi, I’m Cian (pronounced: "k"+"ian", pronouns: he/him) and I’m currently pursuing a PhD in physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. You can find me in the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, room 37-624 :)

* Gravitation
* Particle physics
* Cosmology
* Machine learning
* High-performance computing and big data 
* Multi-messenger astronomy

and where those fields interact.
