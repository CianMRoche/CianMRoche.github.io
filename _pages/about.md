Hi, I’m Cian (pronounced: "k"+"ian", pronouns: he/they) and I’m currently pursuing a PhD in physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

You can find me in the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, room 37-624

### What's on this website?
Some things I've worked on in the past few years, a <a href="/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> and some random code tutorials I've written. 

Also check out [AstroWiki](https://publish.obsidian.md/astrowiki/) which is a comprehensive set of living notes I maintain to aid in studying to for the MIT astrophysics oral qualifying exam.

### Here's a high-level overview of the research areas I'm interested in: 
<p align="center">

and high-performance computing, though I would have had to connect that to just about everything[^1]. In black are the areas in which I'm interested, and the coloured portions represent roughly the real-world connections between those topics.

[^1]: I suppose I could reasonably connect *all* nodes on the graph and not be particularly wrong about anything.
