Hi, I’m Cian (pronounced: "k"+"ian", pronouns: he/him) and I’m currently pursuing a PhD in astrophysics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, supervised by prof. Lina Necib. You can find me in the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research :)\\

Here's a high-level overview of the areas I'm interested in: 

gravitation, particle physics, cosmology, machine learning, big data 

and where those fields interact.\\

On this website you’ll find some things I've worked on in the past few years, some thoughts on ethics, a CV, and pictures of some adventures I've found myself on.
