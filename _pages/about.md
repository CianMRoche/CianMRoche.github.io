# Welcome to my internet home :)

Hi, I’m Cian (pronounced: "k"+"ian", pronouns: he/him) and I’m currently pursuing a PhD in astrophysics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, supervised by prof. Lina Necib. My current research interests lie in gravitation, particle physics, cosmology, machine learning, big data and where those fields interact. On this website you’ll find some things I've worked on in the past few years, some thoughts on ethics, a CV, and pictures of some adventures I've found myself on.
