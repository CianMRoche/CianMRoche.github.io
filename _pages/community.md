    <h2>Graduates Advising Graduate Admissions (GAGA)</h2>
    <p> <strong>Co-Lead</strong>: 06/2022 - ongoing<br>
        <strong>Organising Committee</strong>: 01/2021 - 06/2022<br><br>
        The Graduates Advising Graduate Admissions (GAGA) program provides the graduate student perspective to the Chair of Graduate Admissions and advises on improvements to the admissions process. (It doesnt have a logo so I made this one up as a placeholder). More information <a target="_blank" href="https://physics-gsc.scripts.mit.edu/home/gaga/">here</a>. 
        <br><br>This has also lead me to serve on the admissions committee for the <a target="_blank" href="https://physics.mit.edu/academic-programs/graduate-students/graduate-admissions/">MIT graduate program in physics</a> (2023 & 2024 cycles), and the admissions commitee for the <a target="_blank" href="https://oge.mit.edu/msrp/">MIT Summer Research Program</a> (2023 cycle).

    <h2>MIT Graduate Student Union</h2>
    <p> <strong>Organising Committee</strong>: 01/2022 - ongoing<br><br>
        The MIT Graduate Student Union operates fairly and democratically by distributing responsibility to the division-level. I assist with union operations in the physics department and astrophysics division.

    <h2>UCC Physics and Astronomy Society</h2>
    <p> <strong>Organising Committee</strong>: 2017-2019<br><br>
        I worked with the committee of the University College Cork (UCC) physics and astronomy society for two years, acting primarily as astronomy officer. This involved organizing stargazing trips and a visit to Iceland to see the Northern lights (no aurora were witnessed, not even entirely localized within our kitchen).</p>
