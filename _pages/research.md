Below is a collection of projects on which I've worked with collaborators. The relevant fields include observational astrophysics, theoretical quantum optics, gravitational wave interferometry, nuclear fusion in tokamaks, mathematical foundations of general relativity, and galaxy-scale dynamics as a probe of particle physics.

  <h2>Measuring the Milky Way Mass Profile via Stellar Kinematics</h2>
    <p>The escape velocity profile (and therefore mass profile) of a simulated galaxy or the Milky Way is inferred via Bayesian analysis applied to the local stellar velocity distribution. Simulated datasets from the FIRE collaboration and Milky Way data to come from Gaia DR3. Supervised by Prof. Lina Necib. Article in preparation.</p>

    <h2>Galaxy Mergers as Dark Matter Probes</h2>
    <p>High-resolution N-body simulations of galaxy mergers are used as probes of dark matter properties, and to test models of dark matter-deficient galaxy production (such as DF2 and DF4). Supervised by Prof. Lina Necib. <br><br> Project ongoing.</p>

    <h2>Exact Wavelike Solutions in General Relativity</h2>
    <p>This master thesis project motivates and investigates the mathematical structure of
    pp-wave spacetimes. Topics include Penrose limits, the causal ladder and addressing
    the Ehlers-Kundt conjecture. Supervised by Prof. Carla Cederbaum. <br><br> Submitted to general relativity and gravitation - draft available <a href="/files/Exact_Wavelike_Solutions_in_GR.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Exotic State Preparation in a Triangular Optical Lattice</h2>
    <p>Optical lattices provide highly controllable systems for trapping and exciting gases of ultracold atoms. They are ideal candidates for the quantum simulation of condensed matter systems, for which many implementations require higher orbital occupation. In this report, methods for creating higher orbital states in a triangular optical lattice are developed. <br><br>Report available <a href="/files/lattice.pdf">here</a>

    <h2>High Order Nulls in the Poloidal fields of ASDEX Upgrade</h2>
    <p>ASDEX Upgrade (Axially Symmetric Divertor Experiment) is a magnetic confinement tokamak experiment in the Max Planck Institute for  Plasma Physics in Garching, Germany. Planned upgrades to the tokamak will greatly change the magnetic field structure near the tungsten upper divertor plates in an attempt to flare out flux tubes, thus reducing heat flux on the divertor. This project estimates the accuracy with which the poloidal field probes can resolve the more complex magnetic field structure for varying upper divertor coil (UDC) currents.

    <h2>An Introduction to Signal Processing in Interferometry</h2>
    <p>The basic techniques of signal processing are presented in the context of the detection of gravitational radiation (gravitational wave event GW150914) produced by the merger of a binary black hole system as detected by the Hanford and Livingston LIGO detectors. The target level for this document is undergraduate, with the focus on introducing techniques and gaining intuition for signal processing in general. Largely based on documents and notebooks released by advanced LIGO as detailed in the document. <br><br>Report available <a href="/files/sigpros.pdf">here</a>

    <h2>The Progenitor System of Supernova 1992a</h2>
    <p>An investigation of the progenitor system of supernova (SN) 1992a using late time photometry. The late time light curve of SNe 1a can be modelled via two primary decay mechanisms with intial relative isotopic abundances created by the SN as free parameters. It has been shown that isotopic abundances vary greatly with different progenitor models for SNe 1a, thus by modelling the late time light curve and comparing its evolution to a photometric analysis (using images from Hubble Space Telescope and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory) we can infer a progenitor model.
