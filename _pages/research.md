    <p>The escape velocity profile (and therefore mass profile) of a simulated galaxy or the Milky Way is inferred via Bayesian analysis applied to the local stellar velocity distribution. Simulated datasets from the FIRE collaboration and Milky Way data to come from Gaia DR3. Supervised by Prof. Lina Necib.</p>

    <p>High-resolution N-body simulations of galaxy mergers are used as probes of dark matter properties, and to test models of dark matter-deficient galaxy production (such as DF2 and DF4). Supervised by Prof. Lina Necib.</p>

This master thesis project motivates and investigates the mathematical structure of
pp-wave spacetimes. Topics include Penrose limits, the causal ladder and addressing
the Ehlers-Kundt conjecture. Supervised by Prof. Carla Cederbaum.


### Exotic State Preparation in a Triangular Optical Lattice

Optical lattices provide highly controllable systems for trapping and exciting gases of ultracold atoms. They are ideal candidates for the quantum simulation of condensed matter systems, for which many implementations require higher orbital occupation. In this report, methods for creating higher orbital states in a triangular optical lattice are developed. This is the result of a long-form research project with the quantum optics group at University College Cork, Ireland.

### High Order Nulls in the Poloidal field Structure of ASDEX Upgrade

<img style="left;" src="/images/ippprok.png" width="350" height="350">
ASDEX Upgrade (Axially Symmetric Divertor Experiment) is a magnetic confinement tokamak experiment in the Max Planck Institute for  Plasma Physics in Garching, Germany. Planned magnetic field control coils in the upper divertor of the tokamak will greatly change the magnetic field structure near the tungsten upper divertor plates in an attempt to flare out flux tubes, thus reducing heat flux on the divertor. This theoretical project estimates the accuracy with which the poloidal field probes can resolve the more complex magnetic field structure (ie higher order nulls) for varying upper divertor coil (UDC) currents. Assumptions previously made in the data pipeline of ASDEX Upgrade were also investigated and shown to break down with regular operation level currents in the UDCs. Target level for document â€“ undergraduate/masters student.


### An Introduction to Signal Processing in Interferometry

The basic techniques of signal processing are presented in the context of the detection of gravitational radiation (gravitational wave event GW150914) produced by the merger of a binary black hole system as detected by the Hanford and Livingston LIGO detectors. The target level for this document is undergraduate, with the focus on introducing techniques and gaining intuition for signal processing in general. Largely based on documents and notebooks released by advanced LIGO as detailed in the document.

### The Progenitor System of Supernova 1992a

<img style="left;" src="/images/92a.png" width="350" height="350">
An investigation of the progenitor system of supernova (SN) 1992a using late time photometry. The late time light curve of SNe 1a can be modelled via two primary decay mechanisms with intial relative isotopic abundances created by the SN as free parameters. It has been shown that isotopic abundances vary greatly with different progenitor models for SNe 1a, thus by modelling the late time light curve and comparing its evolution to a photometric analysis (using images from Hubble Space Telescope and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory) we can infer a progenitor model.  Project completed Summer 2017 as part of University of Notre Dame research experience for undergraduates program, carried out with the financial support of the Naughton Fellowship program.
