### Exotic State Preparation in a Triangular Optical Lattice

<img style="float: right;" src="images/lattice.gif">

Optical lattices provide highly controllable systems for trapping and exciting gases of ultracold atoms. They are ideal candidates for the quantum simulation of condensed matter systems, for which many implementations require higher orbital occupation. In this report, methods for creating higher orbital states in a triangular optical lattice are developed. This is the result of a long-form research project with the quantum optics group at University College Cork, Ireland.
