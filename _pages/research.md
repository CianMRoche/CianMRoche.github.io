### Exotic State Preparation in a Triangular Optical Lattice

<img style="float: right;" src="/images/lattice.gif">

Optical lattices provide highly controllable systems for trapping and exciting gases of ultracold atoms. They are ideal candidates for the quantum simulation of condensed matter systems, for which many implementations require higher orbital occupation. In this report, methods for creating higher orbital states in a triangular optical lattice are developed. This is the result of a long-form research project with the quantum optics group at University College Cork, Ireland.


### High Order Nulls in the Poloidal field Structure of ASDEX Upgrade

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/ippprok.png">

ASDEX Upgrade (Axially Symmetric Divertor Experiment) is a magnetic confinement tokamak experiment in the Max Planck Institute for  Plasma Physics in Garching, Germany. Planned magnetic field control coils in the upper divertor of the tokamak will greatly change the magnetic field structure near the tungsten upper divertor plates in an attempt to flare out flux tubes, thus reducing heat flux on the divertor. This theoretical project estimates the accuracy with which the poloidal field probes can resolve the more complex magnetic field structure (ie higher order nulls) for varying upper divertor coil (UDC) currents. Assumptions previously made in the data pipeline of ASDEX Upgrade were also investigated and shown to break down with regular operation level currents in the UDCs. Target level for document â€“ undergraduate/masters student.
