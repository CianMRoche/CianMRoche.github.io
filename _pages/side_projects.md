### Measuring the Milky Way Mass Profile via Stellar Kinematics

<img style="left;" src="/images/corner.png" width="500">

The escape velocity profile (and therefore mass profile) of a simulated galaxy or the
Milky Way is inferred via Bayesian analysis applied to the local stellar velocity distri-
bution. Simulated datasets from the FIRE collaboration and Milky Way data to come
from Gaia DR3. Supervised by Prof. Lina Necib
