The goal of this page is to look at contemporary ethical issues in a way primarily accessible to the STEM-minded among us, since historically academia has not been kind to disenfranchised groups, and it’s important that we as scientists look at things in an objective and consistent way (something which I argue is incompatible with the aforementioned disenfranchising). I will not attempt to write long essays here, if only because it would be too time consuming to write and nobody would read it. I’ll instead endeavor to provide a summary of these issues and the results of my thoughts, conversations and research on them. Perhaps more valuable is that I will also provide some links to some material from people who have dedicated much of their time to issues of morality and logic, and do an amazing job in my opinion. Again, the most important things here are not my words, but the works I link to. Finally if there’s something you disagree with, fantastic! Please email me and we’ll have a discussion, where I’m happy to have my mind changed entirely.

### Veganism: A Good Place to Start

tl;dr For a concise summary of the main arguments against veganism, and why they are logically unsupported, see [this video](https://youtu.be/rS0F4WeG0eo) WARNING: graphic imagery is regularly used. If you are sensitive to abuse as I am, you could simply listen to the audio of this video and get the majority of the value.

=====

There is a stereotype associated with vegetarianism/veganism, that goes along the lines of “How do you know if somebody is a vegan? Don’t worry, they’ll tell you”. This comes from a somewhat reasonable place, as at one point veganism was considered by many as a “health fad”, and few people want to hear their uncle talk about how vital wheat gluten is changing his life. The remaining vegans made the switch for ethical reasons, and being told that we have overlooked an injustice for the sake of our tastebuds is difficult to confront for anybody, and so this is also a conversation we would like to avoid. So the stereotype isn’t unreasonable, especially considering the survivorship bias that comes from a quiet vegan who keeps it to themselves.

I was lucky enough to inherit vegetarianism on one side of my family (thanks mom), and I was a quiet one for the first 22 years of my life. Recently though, I’ve decided to be a bit more active about it. Not in a judgemental way, as this is almost always unproductive, but rather by having conversations with people about confronting bias, and establishing consistent moral and ethical codes. I forsee veganism as one of the defining moral characteristics of this century, or perhaps longer. It’s good to be an early adopter when ethics are on the line.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1vW9iSpLLk) is a video from CosmicSkeptic last year, which is a purely philosophical and moral discussion about veganism, from the perspective of a person who at the time, did eat meat. (No slaughterhouse videos, no climate change graphs). This avoids the appeal to emotion which doesn’t always lead us in morally consistent directions.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnykmsDetNo) is a more emotive appeal which came about one year later, presumably after he received no convincing rebuttal to the points made in the first video. This deals much more directly with the cognitive dissonance involved when an individual feels empathy for charismatic megafauna (like a dog or a penguin) but doesn’t think about the literal millions of animals suffering beyond comprehension their entire lives for the meat industry.
