The goal of this page is to look at contemporary ethical issues in a way primarily accessible to the STEM-minded among us, since historically academia has not been kind to disenfranchised groups, and it’s important that we as scientists look at things in an objective and consistent way (something which I argue is incompatible with the aforementioned disenfranchising). I will not attempt to write long essays here, if only because it would be too time consuming to write and nobody would read it. I’ll instead endeavor to provide a summary of these issues and the results of my thoughts, conversations and research on them. Perhaps more valuable is that I will also provide some links to some material from people who have dedicated much of their time to issues of morality and logic, and do an amazing job in my opinion. Again, the most important things here are not my words, but the works I link to. Finally if there’s something you disagree with, fantastic! Please email me and we’ll have a discussion, where I’m happy to have my mind changed entirely.

### Veganism: A Good Place to Start

tl;dr For a concise summary of the main arguments against veganism, and why they are logically unsupported, see [this video](https://youtu.be/rS0F4WeG0eo) WARNING: graphic imagery is regularly used. If you are sensitive to abuse as I am, you could simply listen to the audio of this video and get the majority of the value.

=====

There is a stereotype associated with vegetarianism/veganism, that goes along the lines of “How do you know if somebody is a vegan? Don’t worry, they’ll tell you”. This comes from a somewhat reasonable place, as at one point veganism was considered by many as a “health fad”, and few people want to hear their uncle talk about how vital wheat gluten is changing his life. The remaining vegans made the switch for ethical reasons, and being told that we have overlooked an injustice for the sake of our tastebuds is difficult to confront for anybody, and so this is also a conversation we would like to avoid. So the stereotype isn’t unreasonable, especially considering the survivorship bias that comes from a quiet vegan who keeps it to themselves.

I was lucky enough to inherit vegetarianism on one side of my family (thanks mom), and I was a quiet one for the first 22 years of my life. Recently though, I’ve decided to be a bit more active about it. Not in a judgemental way, as this is almost always unproductive, but rather by having conversations with people about confronting bias, and establishing consistent moral and ethical codes. I forsee veganism as one of the defining moral characteristics of this century, or perhaps longer. It’s good to be an early adopter when ethics are on the line.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1vW9iSpLLk) is a video from CosmicSkeptic last year, which is a purely philosophical and moral discussion about veganism, from the perspective of a person who at the time, did eat meat. (No slaughterhouse videos, no climate change graphs). This avoids the appeal to emotion which doesn’t always lead us in morally consistent directions.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnykmsDetNo) is a more emotive appeal which came about one year later, presumably after he received no convincing rebuttal to the points made in the first video. This deals much more directly with the cognitive dissonance involved when an individual feels empathy for charismatic megafauna (like a dog or a penguin) but doesn’t think about the literal millions of animals suffering beyond comprehension their entire lives for the meat industry.

Above is an image I’m stealing from the fantastic source Our World in Data, who do an amazing job of presenting scientifically sound data in an intuitive way. There is a clear message in this graph; meat consumption and production is, and has essentially always been, on the rise. Here are three viewpoints from which one could approach the problem that is the meat industry:

1. Meat consumption is an environmental issue. If everybody reduces their consumption over time, we may reach acceptable levels.
2. Meat consumption is a moral issue, as soon as you realize what you’re doing, it is your responsibility to stop.
3. It’s both, and the moral argument in many ways encapsulates the environmental one.

Of course one could also say it’s not an issue or even “it is an issue and I don’t care”, but I don’t believe a productive conversation will come from this line of thinking. Also it’s important to note that it is no individual’s fault that they are part of a society which has normalized these practices, the goal here is not to shame anyone, but rather to identify inconsistencies in our moral framework and fix them as soon as we possibly can. I very much subscribe to the third idea above. That is, if we care about preventing the suffering of conscious beings in general (or even just humans!) we should each hold ourselves to a level of personal responsibility that either significantly reduces our meat and animal product consumption, or eradicates it entirely. If you still consume meat/ animal products, spend some time researching and thinking. Nobody is too busy to check if they’re committing gross affronts against life whenever they go to the supermarket.
