The goal of this page is to look at contemporary ethical issues in a way primarily accessible to the STEM-minded among us, since historically academia has not been kind to disenfranchised groups, and it’s important that we as scientists look at things in an objective and consistent way (something which I argue is incompatible with the aforementioned disenfranchising). I will not attempt to write long essays here, if only because it would be too time consuming to write and nobody would read it. I’ll instead endeavor to provide a summary of these issues and the results of my thoughts, conversations and research on them. Perhaps more valuable is that I will also provide some links to some material from people who have dedicated much of their time to issues of morality and logic, and do an amazing job in my opinion. Again, the most important things here are not my words, but the works I link to. Finally if there’s something you disagree with, fantastic! Please email me and we’ll have a discussion, where I’m happy to have my mind changed entirely.

# Veganism: A Good Place to Start

tl;dr For a concise summary of the main arguments against veganism, and why they are logically unsupported, see [this video](https://youtu.be/rS0F4WeG0eo) WARNING: graphic imagery is regularly used. If you are sensitive to abuse as I am, you could simply listen to the audio of this video and get the majority of the value.

There is a stereotype associated with vegetarianism/veganism, that goes along the lines of “How do you know if somebody is a vegan? Don’t worry, they’ll tell you”. This comes from a somewhat reasonable place, as at one point veganism was considered by many as a “health fad”, and few people want to hear their uncle talk about how vital wheat gluten is changing his life. The remaining vegans made the switch for ethical reasons, and being told that we have overlooked an injustice for the sake of our tastebuds is difficult to confront for anybody, and so this is also a conversation we would like to avoid. So the stereotype isn’t unreasonable, especially considering the survivorship bias that comes from a quiet vegan who keeps it to themselves.

I was lucky enough to inherit vegetarianism on one side of my family (thanks mom), and I was a quiet one for the first 22 years of my life. Recently though, I’ve decided to be a bit more active about it. Not in a judgemental way, as this is almost always unproductive, but rather by having conversations with people about confronting bias, and establishing consistent moral and ethical codes. I forsee veganism as one of the defining moral characteristics of this century, or perhaps longer. It’s good to be an early adopter when ethics are on the line.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1vW9iSpLLk) is a video from CosmicSkeptic last year, which is a purely philosophical and moral discussion about veganism, from the perspective of a person who at the time, did eat meat. (No slaughterhouse videos, no climate change graphs). This avoids the appeal to emotion which doesn’t always lead us in morally consistent directions.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnykmsDetNo) is a more emotive appeal which came about one year later, presumably after he received no convincing rebuttal to the points made in the first video. This deals much more directly with the cognitive dissonance involved when an individual feels empathy for charismatic megafauna (like a dog or a penguin) but doesn’t think about the literal millions of animals suffering beyond comprehension their entire lives for the meat industry.

Above is an image I’m stealing from the fantastic source Our World in Data, who do an amazing job of presenting scientifically sound data in an intuitive way. There is a clear message in this graph; meat consumption and production is, and has essentially always been, on the rise. Here are three viewpoints from which one could approach the problem that is the meat industry:

1. Meat consumption is an environmental issue. If everybody reduces their consumption over time, we may reach acceptable levels.
2. Meat consumption is a moral issue, as soon as you realize what you’re doing, it is your responsibility to stop.
3. It’s both, and the moral argument in many ways encapsulates the environmental one.

Of course one could also say it’s not an issue or even “it is an issue and I don’t care”, but I don’t believe a productive conversation will come from this line of thinking. Also it’s important to note that it is no individual’s fault that they are part of a society which has normalized these practices, the goal here is not to shame anyone, but rather to identify inconsistencies in our moral framework and fix them as soon as we possibly can. I very much subscribe to the third idea above. That is, if we care about preventing the suffering of conscious beings in general (or even just humans!) we should each hold ourselves to a level of personal responsibility that either significantly reduces our meat and animal product consumption, or eradicates it entirely. If you still consume meat/ animal products, spend some time researching and thinking. Nobody is too busy to check if they’re committing gross affronts against life whenever they go to the supermarket.


# Gender Identity and the Importance of Fabric Shape
I will have less to say here, as it seems pretty clear that the world is moving in the right direction. To those among us who want to be accepting of people and do good in the world, but struggle with the logical consistency of what could be described as “modern” gender identity politics, I offer the following overview of the modern view on gender: [Understanding Gender](https://genderspectrum.org/articles/understanding-gender).

It boils down to the idea that in emergent phenomena as complicated as human beings and the society we have established, it would be unreasonable to suggest that we can place all of humanity into one of two boxes, and expect everybody to feel comfortable in those boxes. One’s box determines many things about their life, including how people value them, treat them, the opportunities they are offered, and the shape of fabric which people consider acceptable for them to wear on their bodies.

Ideas of this nature came to a head recently, as many people lost their minds over [Harry Styles wearing a dress](https://www.vogue.com/article/harry-styles-cover-december-2020), and subsequent people lost their minds over people losing their minds. Indeed, this is such an odd thing to be upset about, when one takes a step back and tries to be a little more objective. It’s important to note that there’s no shame in being surprised by the Vogue cover, or by the cut of the clothes on a person one may encounter on the street. Simply because of it’s rarity, many of us would look twice at a man in a dress, but the point is that to achieve a world in which everybody can feel comfortable, that must be the end of it. One can be surprised by something, and then recognize that really, nothing is amiss at all, and we can all go back about our business. In fact in the end, I believe the goal is to no longer see a “man in a dress”, where we assume what role a person wishes to play in society based solely on their bone structure or hair or anything else superficial, but rather to just see a person, without feeling the need to put them in one of those boxes, and treat them with the respect we would anybody else. Us scientists love to categorize things, and put them neatly into boxes. This works sometimes, like when we arbitrarily assign the name “green” to a wavelength of 550 nm, but green doesn’t have feelings, and green doesn’t quite have the same right to choose it’s place in society the way a human being does. Move a little to the one side of green and you’ll find dark green, the other side and you’ll find light. We don’t have such simple qualifiers for human beings, even sex is not as binary as one may think! (See above link to understanding gender).

If you want to get used to seeing “men in dresses” and have an amazing time while you’re at it, check out drag queens like Trixie Mattel and Katya Zamolodchikova. They have a Youtube series called [UNHhhh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYXbhuObeGI&feature=youtu.be), and it’s how I got into the scene. It quickly became one of my favourite things I’ve ever seen, and it really helps one get over the ideas that would serve to do little but make people feel uncomfortable for no good reason.


# Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Programs
Summary: It is easy to say “the solution to $x$ discrimination is to discriminate based on $y$ ????” which does indeed feel like a fallacy, however in truth the true goal of programs such as these is not to eradicate discrimination (though this should be and is a goal of society), but rather to correct for the mistakes of the past, and to account for their very real modern-day ramifications. To correct for the subtle societal barriers to entry that were born of mistreatment of minorities and women in the past, it is necessary to make some concessions in the present. I am a heterosexual white man, what I am saying (if immediately adopted by everyone who hasn’t already) would serve to weaken my opportunities. This does not make me a good person, and we’ll ignore the possibility that this is all virtue signaling, but rather this is the most ethical way to approach this topic. It’s not admirable to support these initiatives, it is a minimum requirement.

It is also possible to think that the gender gap in science is justified. This fact one may have encountered via public figures like Jordan Peterson, or this infamous talk at a women in physics conference. A response to the points made in this talk (with the conclusion that it is a mighty pseudo-scientific bait and switch) can be found here on the Quantum Messenger blog. One of the major problems with arguments to the effect of “nothing is amiss at all, if anything we are starting to be sexist towards men” is that for the few claims that are backed up by some data, the data they use comes from the current and past academic system. They present things like “male physicists produce papers which are cited more as their academic careers progress, as compared to female physicists in the same positions”. What they fail to realise in this however, is that this is part of the problem! Unconscious (or even conscious) bias and unaccounted for responsibilities and barriers experienced by women in STEM result in them receiving less opportunities and being taken less seriously. Citations have an element of being a scientific popularity contest, and the works of women have long been unfairly overlooked (in a statistical sense, of course not every woman and every paper a woman is involved with is passed over). Thus using citations as a metric to say women are treated completely fairly, as the less scientifically-inclined on average, is complete nonsense. Its like taking money from a persons pocket, then they complain that they are poor and would like the same amount of money as you, and you say “of course you’re poor, look in your pocket, everything checks out! In fact, you’re harassing me asking for money!”. The difference here of course is many men are not aware that they have taken the money, nor are they aware that their predecessors in the field had been embezzling for years and years. I’ve gone too far into the analogy.
